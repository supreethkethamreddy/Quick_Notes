# Quick_Notes
Quick Notes App is a web application in which users can create new notes, read, update, delete existing notes (CRUD Operations) in the local system. I used node js for running a web server in a local system and express js framework to route the application. Database used is MongoDB in which it will store all information .Data can be seen by others.
